# Netflix-clone
The Netflix Clone is a frontend project built using HTML5 and CSS3. It replicates Netflixâ€™s homepage with sections like header, hero, features, FAQ, and footer. It uses Flexbox and media queries for responsiveness. The project improves layout skills and UI design, with plans to add JavaScript and host it online.
